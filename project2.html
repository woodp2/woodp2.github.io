            <p class="page2text">In 1967, developers at Sanders Associates, Inc., led by Ralph Baer, invented a prototype multiplayer, multi-program video game system that could be played on a television. It was known as “The Brown Box.”</p>
            <p class="page2text">Baer, who’s sometimes referred to as Father of Video Games, licensed his device to Magnavox, which sold the system to consumers as the Odyssey, the first video game home console, in 1972. Over the next few years, the primitive Odyssey console would commercially fizzle and die out.</p>
            <p class="page2text">Yet, one of the Odyssey’s 28 games was the inspiration for Atari’s Pong, the first arcade video game, which the company released in 1972. In 1975, Atari released a home version of Pong, which was as successful as its arcade counterpart.</p>
            <p class="page2text">Magnavox, along with Sanders Associates, would eventually sue Atari for copyright infringement. Atari settled and became an Odyssey licensee; over the next 20 years, Magnavox went on to win more than $100 million in copyright lawsuits related to the Odyssey and its video game patents.</p>
            <p class="page2text">In 1977, Atari released the Atari 2600 (also known as the Video Computer System), a home console that featured joysticks and interchangeable game cartridges that played multi-colored games, effectively kicking off the second generation of the video game consoles.</p>
            <p class="page2text">The video game industry had a few notable milestones in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The release of the Space Invaders arcade game in 1978</li>
                <li>The launch of Activision, the first third-party game developer (which develops software without making consoles or arcade cabinets), in 1979</li>
                <li>The introduction to the United States of Japan’s hugely popular Pac-Man</li>
                <li>Nintendo’s creation of Donkey Kong, which introduced the world to the character Mario</li>
                <li>Microsoft's release of its first Flight Simualator Game</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="page2text">In 1983, the North American video game industry experienced a major “crash” due to a number of factors, including an oversaturated game console market, competition from computer gaming, and a surplus of over-hyped, low-quality games, such as the infamous E.T., an Atari game based on the eponymous movie and often considered the worst game ever created.</p>
            <p class="page2text">Lasting a couple of years, the crash led to the bankruptcy of several home computer and video game console companies.</p>
            <p class="page2text">The video game home industry began to recover in 1985 when the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), called Famicom in Japan, came to the United States. The NES had improved 8-bit graphics, colors, sound and gameplay over previous consoles.</p>
            <p class="page2text">Nintendo, a Japanese company that began as a playing card manufacturer in 1889, released a number of important video game franchises still around today, such as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.</p>
            <p class="page2text">Additionally, Nintendo imposed various regulations on third-party games developed for its system, helping to combat rushed, low-quality software. Third-party developers released many other long-lasting franchises, such as Capcom’s Mega Man, Konami’s Castlevania, Square’s Final Fantasy, and Enix’s Dragon Quest (Square and Enix would later merge to form Square Enix in 2003).</p>
            <p class="page2text">In 1989, Nintendo made waves again by popularizing handheld gaming with the release of its 8-bit Game Boy video game device and the often-bundled game Tetris. Over the next 25 years, Nintendo would release a number of successful successors to the Game Boy, including the Game Boy color in 1998, Nintendo DS in 2004, and Nintendo 3DS in 2011.</p>
